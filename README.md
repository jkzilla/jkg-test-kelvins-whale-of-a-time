# Whale of a Time!

This repository explores all the typical Docker-related operations within CI builds.

In these samples, we will be using CircleCI for our CI builds.

Please see the various workflows declared in `.circleci/config.yml` for examples.


## Notes

A lot of these examples can really be simplified by using the Docker orb offered by CircleCI!

However, in these examples, I would like to keep it as 'low-tech' as possible.
